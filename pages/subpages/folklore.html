            I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit<br>
            Been saying "yes" instead of "no"<br>
            I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though<br>
            <br>
            I hit the ground running each night<br>
            I hit the Sunday matinee<br>
            You know the greatest films of all time were never made<br>
            <br>
            I guess you never know, never know<br>
            And if you wanted me, you really should've showed<br>
            And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow<br>
            And it's alright now<br>
            <br>
            But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
            Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
            And if my wishes came true<br>
            It would've been you<br>
            In my defense, I have none<br>
            For never leaving well enough alone<br>
            But it would've been fun<br>
            If you would've been the one<br>
            <br>
            I have this dream you're doing cool shit<br>
            Having adventures on your own<br>
            You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home<br>
            We never painted by the numbers, baby<br>
            But we were making it count<br>
            You know the greatest loves of all time are over now<br>
            <br>
            I guess you never know, never know<br>
            And it's another day, waking up alone<br>
            <br>
            But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
            Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
            And if my wishes came true<br>
            It would've been you<br>
            In my defense, I have none<br>
            For never leaving well enough alone<br>
            But it would've been fun<br>
            If you would've been the one<br>
            <br>
            Hey, yeah-yeah<br>
            I persist and resist the temptation to ask you<br>
            If one thing had been different<br>
            Would everything be different today?<br>
            <br>
            We were something, don't you think so?<br>
            Rosé flowing with your chosen family<br>
            And it would've been sweet<br>
            If it could've been me<br>
            In my defense, I have none<br>
            For digging up the grave another time<br>
            But it would've been fun<br>
            If you would've been the one

            Vintage tee, brand new phone<br>
            High heels on cobblestones<br>
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
            Sequin smile, black lipstick<br>
            Sensual politics<br>
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
            <br>
            But I knew you<br>
            Dancing in your Levi's<br>
            Drunk under a streetlight, I<br>
            I knew you<br>
            Hand under my sweatshirt<br>
            Baby, kiss it better, I<br>
            <br>
            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
            You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
            A friend to all is a friend to none<br>
            Chase two girls, lose the one<br>
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>

            But I knew you<br>
            Playing hide-and-seek and<br>
            Giving me your weekends<br>
            I, I knew you<br>
            Your heartbeat on the High Line<br>
            Once in twenty lifetimes, I<br>
            <br>
            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
            You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
            <br>
            To kiss in cars and downtown bars<br>
            Was all we needed<br>
            You drew stars around my scars<br>
            But now I'm bleeding<br>
            <br>
            'Cause I knew you<br>
            Stepping on the last train<br>
            Marked me like a bloodstain, I<br>
            I knew you<br>
            Tried to change the ending<br>
            Peter losing Wendy<br>
            I, I knew you<br>
            Leaving like a father<br>
            Running like water, I<br>
            And when you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
            <br>
            But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss<br>
            I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs<br>
            The smell of smoke would hang around this long<br>
            'Cause I knew everything when I was young<br>
            I knew I'd curse you for the longest time<br>
            Chasing shadows in the grocery line<br>
            I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired<br>
            And you'd be standing in my front porch light<br>
            And I knew you'd come back to me<br>
            You'd come back to me<br>
            And you'd come back to me<br>
            And you'd come back<br>
            <br>
            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
            You put me on and said I was your favorite

        <p id="dev-cal-2">
            Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny<br>
            Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis<br>
            Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money<br>
            And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"<br>
            <br>
            The wedding was charming, if a little gauche<br>
            There's only so far new money goes<br>
            They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"<br>
            Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud<br>
            The doctor had told him to settle down<br>
            It must have been her fault his heart gave out<br>
            <br>
            And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
            Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been<br>
            There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen<br>
            She had a marvelous time ruining everything."<br>
            <br>
            Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever<br>
            Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city<br>
            Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names<br>
            And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet<br>
            And losing on card game bets with Dalí<br>
            <br>
            And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
            Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been<br>
            There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen<br>
            She had a marvelous time ruining everything."<br>
            <br>
            They say she was seen on occasion<br>
            Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea<br>
            And in a feud with her neighbor<br>
            She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green<br>
            Fifty years is a long time<br>
            Holiday House sat quietly on that beach<br>
            Free of women with madness<br>
            Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me<br>
            <br>
            Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been<br>
            There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen<br>
            I had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
            I had a marvelous time<br>
            Ruining everything<br>
            A marvelous time<br>
            Ruining everything<br>
            A marvelous time<br>
            I had a marvelous time

            I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
            And you're the hero flying around saving face<br>
            And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?<br>
            Cursing my name<br>
            Wishing I stayed<br>
            Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
            <br>
            We gather stones<br>
            Never knowing what they'll mean<br>
            Some to throw<br>
            Some to make a diamond ring<br>
            You know I didn't want to<br>
            Have to haunt you<br>
            But what a ghostly scene<br>
            You wear the same jewels<br>
            That I gave you<br>
            As you bury me<br>
            <br>
            I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
            'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave<br>
            And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?<br>
            Cursing my name<br>
            Wishing I stayed<br>
            Look at how my tears ricochet<br>
            <br>
            And I can go anywhere I want<br>
            Anywhere I want<br>
            Just not home<br>
            And you can aim for my heart, go for blood<br>
            But you would still miss me in your bones<br>
            And I still talk to you<br>
            When I'm screaming at the sky<br>
            And when you can't sleep at night<br>
            You hear my stolen lullabies<br>
            <br>
            I didn't have it in myself to go with grace<br>
            And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves<br>
            You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same<br>
            Cursing my name<br>
            Wishing I stayed<br>
            You turned into your worst fears<br>
            And you're tossing out blame<br>
            Drunk on this pain<br>
            Crossing out the good years<br>
            And you're cursing my name<br>
            Wishing I stayed<br>
            Look at how my tears ricochet

            I'll get you out on the floor<br>
            Shimmering beautiful<br>
            And when I break it's in a million pieces<br>
            <br>
            Hush<br>
            When no one is around, my dear<br>

            Shining just for you<br>
            Hush<br>
            I know they said the end is near<br>

            Shining just for you<br>

            You are not like the regulars<br>
            The masquerade revelers<br>
            Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten<br>
            <br>
            Hush<br>
            When no one is around, my dear<br>

            And they called off the circus<br>
            Burned the disco down<br>
            When they sent home the horses<br>
            And the rodeo clowns<br>
            I'm still on that tightrope<br>
            I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me<br>
            I'm still a believer but I don't know why<br>

            I'm still trying everything<br>
            To keep you looking at me<br>
            <br>
            Because I'm a mirrorball<br>
            I'm a mirrorball<br>

            Please picture me<br>
            In the trees<br>
            I hit my peak at seven<br>
            Feet<br>
            In the swing<br>
            Over the creek<br>
            I was too scared to jump in, but I, I was high<br>
            In the sky<br>
            With Pennsylvania under me<br>
            Are there still beautiful things?<br>
            <br>
            Sweet tea in the summer<br>
            Cross your heart, won't tell no other<br>
            And though I can't recall your face<br>
            I still got love for you<br>
            Your braids like a pattern<br>
            Love you to the moon and to Saturn<br>
            Passed down like folk songs<br>
            The love lasts so long<br>
            <br>
            And I've been meaning to tell you<br>
            I think your house is haunted<br>
            Your dad is always mad and that must be why<br>
            And I think you should come live with<br>
            Me and we can be pirates<br>
            Then you won't have to cry<br>
            Or hide in the closet<br>
            And just like a folk song<br>
            Our love will be passed on<br>
            <br>
            Please picture me<br>
            In the weeds<br>
            Before I learned civility<br>
            I used to scream<br>
            Ferociously<br>
            Any time I wanted<br>
            I, I<br>
            <br>
            Sweet tea in the summer<br>
            Cross my heart, won't tell no other<br>
            And though I can't recall your face<br>
            I still got love for you<br>
            Pack your dolls and a sweater<br>
            We'll move to India forever<br>
            Passed down like folk songs<br>
            Our love lasts so long

            Salt air<br>
            And the rust on your door<br>
            I never needed anything more<br>
            Whispers<br>
            Of "Are you sure?"<br>
            "Never have I ever before"<br>
            <br>
            But I can see us<br>
            Lost in the memory<br>
            August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
            'Cause it was never mine<br>
            And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
            August sipped away<br>
            Like a bottle of wine<br>
            'Cause you were never mine<br>
            <br>
            Your back<br>
            Beneath the sun<br>
            Wishing I could write my name on it<br>
            Will you call when you're back at school?<br>
            I remember thinking I had you<br>

            <br>
            Back when we were still changing for the better<br>
            Wanting was enough<br>
            For me, it was enough<br>
            To live for the hope of it all<br>
            Cancel plans just in case you'd call<br>
            And say "Meet me behind the mall"<br>
            So much for summer love, and saying "Us"<br>
            'Cause you weren't mine to lose<br>
            You weren't mine to lose<br>
            No<br>
            <br>
            But I can see us<br>
            Lost in the memory<br>

            <br>
            'Cause you were never mine<br>
            Never mine<br>
            But do you remember?<br>
            Remember when I pulled up<br>
            And said "Get in the car"<br>
            And then canceled my plans<br>
            Just in case you'd call?<br>
            Back when I was living for the hope of it all<br>
            For the hope of it all<br>

            I've been having a hard time adjusting<br>
            I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting<br>
            I didn't know if you'd care if I came back<br>
            I have a lot of regrets about that<br>
            Pulled the car off the road to the lookout<br>
            Could've followed my fears all the way down<br>
            And maybe I don't quite know what to say<br>
            But I'm here in your doorway<br>
            <br>
            I just wanted you to know<br>

            They told me all of my cages were mental<br>
            So I got wasted like all my potential<br>
            And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad<br>
            I have a lot of regrets about that<br>
            I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere<br>
            Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here<br>
            Pourin' out my heart to a stranger<br>
            But I didn't pour the whiskey<br>
            <br>
            I just wanted you to know<br>
            That this is me trying<br>
            I just wanted you to know<br>
            That this is me trying<br>
            <br>
            At least I'm trying<br>
            <br>
            And it's hard to be at a party<br>
            When I feel like an open wound<br>
            It's hard to be anywhere these days<br>
            When all I want is you<br>
            You're a flashback in a film reel<br>
            On the one screen in my town<br>
            <br>
            And I just wanted you to know<br>
            That this is me trying (And maybe I don't quite know what to say)<br>
            I just wanted you to know<br>

            Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park<br>
            I used to think I would meet somebody there<br>
            Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop<br>
            You used to work at to make a little money<br>
            <br>
            Time<br>
            Curious time<br>
            Gave me no compasses<br>
            Gave me no signs<br>
            Were there clues I didn't see?<br>
            And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
            All along there was some<br>
            Invisible string<br>
            Tying you to me?<br>
            <br>
            Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA<br>
            You ate at my favorite spot for dinner<br>
            Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes<br>
            She said I looked like an American singer<br>
            <br>
            Time<br>
            Mystical time<br>
            Cutting me open, then healing me fine<br>
            Were there clues I didn't see?<br>
            And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
            All along there was some<br>

            Tying you to me?<br>
            <br>
            A string that pulled me<br>
            Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar<br>
            Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire<br>
            Chains around my demons<br>
            Wool to brave the seasons<br>
            One single thread of gold tied me to you<br>
            <br>
            Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart<br>
            Now I send their babies presents<br>
            Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park<br>
            Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven<br>
            <br>
            Time<br>
            Wondrous time<br>
            Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies<br>
            And it's cool<br>
            Baby with me<br>
            And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
            All along there was some<br>
            Invisible string<br>
            Tying you to me?<br>
            <br>
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
            Me<br>
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
            <br>
            (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
            (Ah-ah-ah)

            What did you think I'd say to that?<br>
            Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?<br>
            They strike to kill and you know I will<br>
            You know I will<br>
            <br>
            What do you sing on your drive home?<br>
            Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?<br>
            Does she smile?<br>
            Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?<br>
            <br>
            Every time you call me crazy<br>
            I get more crazy<br>

            My cannons all firing at your yacht<br>
            They say "move on"<br>
            But you know I won't<br>
            And women like hunting witches, too<br>
            Doing your dirtiest work for you<br>
            It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together<br>
            <br>
            Every time you call me crazy<br>
            I get more crazy<br>

            And there's nothing like a mad woman<br>
            What a shame she went mad<br>
            No one likes a mad woman<br>
            You made her like that<br>

            I'm taking my time<br>
            Taking my time<br>
            'Cause you took everything from me<br>
            Watching you climb<br>
            Watching you climb<br>
            Over people like me<br>
            The master of spin<br>
            Has a couple side flings<br>
            Good wives always know<br>
            She should be mad<br>
            Should be scathing like me<br>
            But no one likes a mad woman<br>
            What a shame she went mad<br>
            <br>
            You made her like that

            Betty, I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom<br>
            But I think it's 'cause of me<br>
            Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house<br>
            It's like I couldn't breathe<br>
            You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
            You can't believe a word she says<br>
            Most times, but this time it was true<br>
            The worst thing that I ever did<br>
            Was what I did to you<br>
            <br>
            But if I just showed up at your party<br>
            Would you have me?<br>
            Would you want me?<br>
            Would you tell me to go fuck myself<br>
            Or lead me to the garden?<br>
            In the garden would you trust me<br>
            If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br>
            I'm only seventeen<br>
            I don't know anything but I know I miss you<br>
            <br>
            Betty, I know where it all went wrong<br>
            Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym<br>
            I was nowhere to be found, I hate the crowds, you know that<br>
            Plus, I saw you dance with him<br>
            You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
            You can't believe a word she says<br>
            Most times, but this time it was true<br>
            The worst thing that I ever did<br>
            Was what I did to you<br>
            <br>
            But if I just showed up at your party<br>
            Would you have me?<br>
            Would you want me?<br>
            Would you tell me to go fuck myself<br>
            Or lead me to the garden?<br>
            In the garden would you trust me<br>
            If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br>
            I'm only seventeen<br>
            I don't know anything but I know I miss you<br>
            <br>
            I was walking home on broken cobblestones<br>
            Just thinking of you when she pulled up<br>
            Like a figment of my worst intentions<br>
            She said "James, get in, let's drive"<br>
            Those days turned into nights<br>
            Slept next to her but<br>
            I dreamt of you all summer long<br>
            <br>
            Betty, I'm here on your doorstep<br>
            And I planned it out for weeks now but, it's finally sinking in<br>
            Betty, right now is the last time<br>
            I can dream about what happens when you see my face again<br>
            The only thing I wanna do<br>
            Is make it up to you<br>
            <br>
            So, I showed up at your party<br>
            Yeah, I showed up at your party<br>
            Yeah, I showed up at your party<br>
            Will you have me?<br>
            Will you love me?<br>
            Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?<br>
            If you kiss me<br>
            Will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings?<br>
            I'm only seventeen<br>
            I don't know anything<br>
            But I know I miss you<br>
            Standing in your cardigan<br>
            Kissing in my car again<br>
            Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you

            Our coming-of-age has come and gone<br>
            Suddenly this summer it's clear<br>
            I never had the courage of my convictions<br>
            As long as danger is near<br>
            And it's just around the corner, darlin'<br>
            'Cause it lives in me<br>
            No, I could never give you peace<br>
            <br>
            But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm<br>
            If your cascade ocean wave blues come<br>
            All these people think love's for show<br>
            But I would die for you in secret<br>
            The devil's in the details<br>
            But you got a friend in me<br>
            Would it be enough<br>
            If I could never give you peace?<br>
            <br>
            Your integrity makes me seem small<br>
            You paint dreamscapes on the wall<br>
            I talk shit with my friends<br>
            It's like I'm wastin' your honor<br>
            <br>
            And you know that I'd<br>
            Swing with you for the fences<br>
            Sit with you in the trenches<br>
            Give you my wild, give you a child<br>
            Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other<br>
            Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother<br>
            Is it enough?<br>
            But there's robbers to the east<br>
            Clowns to the West<br>
            I'd give you my sunshine<br>
            Give you my best<br>
            But the rain is always gonna come<br>
            If you're standing with me<br>
            <br>
            But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm<br>
            If your cascade ocean wave blues come<br>
            All these people think love's for show<br>
            But I would die for you in secret<br>
            The devil's in the details<br>

            If I could never give you peace?<br>

            Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry<br>
            I'm setting off, but not without my muse<br>
            <br>
            What should be over burrowed under my skin<br>
            In heart-stopping waves of hurt<br>
            I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze<br>
            Tell me what are my words worth<br>
            <br>
            Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die<br>
            I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you<br>
            Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry<br>
            I'm setting off, but not without my muse<br>
            <br>
            I want auroras and sad prose<br>
            I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet<br>
            'Cause I haven't moved in years<br>
            And I want you right here<br>
            A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground<br>
            With no one around to tweet it<br>
            While I bathe in cliffside pools<br>
            With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief<br>
            <br>
            Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die<br>
            I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you<br>
            Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry<br>
            I'm setting off, but not without my muse<br>
            No, not without you
