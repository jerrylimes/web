            I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit<br>
            Been saying "yes" instead of "no"<br>
            I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though<br>
            <br>
            I hit the ground running each night<br>
            I hit the Sunday matinee<br>
            You know the greatest films of all time were never made<br>
            <br>
            I guess you never know, never know<br>
            And if you wanted me, you really should've showed<br>
            And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow<br>
            And it's alright now<br>
            <br>
            But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
            Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
            And if my wishes came true<br>
            It would've been you<br>
            In my defense, I have none<br>
            For never leaving well enough alone<br>
            But it would've been fun<br>
            If you would've been the one<br>
            <br>
            I have this dream you're doing cool shit<br>
            Having adventures on your own<br>
            You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home<br>
            We never painted by the numbers, baby<br>
            But we were making it count<br>
            You know the greatest loves of all time are over now<br>
            <br>
            I guess you never know, never know<br>
            And it's another day, waking up alone<br>
            <br>
            But we were something, don't you think so?<br>
            Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool<br>
            And if my wishes came true<br>
            It would've been you<br>
            In my defense, I have none<br>
            For never leaving well enough alone<br>
            But it would've been fun<br>
            If you would've been the one<br>
            <br>
            Hey, yeah-yeah<br>
            I persist and resist the temptation to ask you<br>
            If one thing had been different<br>
            Would everything be different today?<br>
            <br>
            We were something, don't you think so?<br>
            Rosé flowing with your chosen family<br>
            And it would've been sweet<br>
            If it could've been me<br>
            In my defense, I have none<br>
            For digging up the grave another time<br>
            But it would've been fun<br>
            If you would've been the one

        <p id="dev-cal-2">
            Vintage tee, brand new phone<br>
            High heels on cobblestones<br>
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
            Sequin smile, black lipstick<br>
            Sensual politics<br>
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
            <br>
            But I knew you<br>
            Dancing in your Levi's<br>
            Drunk under a streetlight, I<br>
            I knew you<br>
            Hand under my sweatshirt<br>
            Baby, kiss it better, I<br>
            <br>
            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
            You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
            A friend to all is a friend to none<br>
            Chase two girls, lose the one<br>
            When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
            <br>
            But I knew you<br>
            Playing hide-and-seek and<br>
            Giving me your weekends<br>
            I, I knew you<br>
            Your heartbeat on the High Line<br>
            Once in twenty lifetimes, I<br>
            <br>
            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
            You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
            <br>
            To kiss in cars and downtown bars<br>
            Was all we needed<br>
            You drew stars around my scars<br>
            But now I'm bleeding<br>
            <br>
            'Cause I knew you<br>
            Stepping on the last train<br>
            Marked me like a bloodstain, I<br>
            I knew you<br>
            Tried to change the ending<br>
            Peter losing Wendy<br>
            I, I knew you<br>
            Leaving like a father<br>
            Running like water, I<br>
            And when you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
            <br>
            But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss<br>
            I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs<br>
            The smell of smoke would hang around this long<br>
            'Cause I knew everything when I was young<br>
            I knew I'd curse you for the longest time<br>
            Chasing shadows in the grocery line<br>
            I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired<br>
            And you'd be standing in my front porch light<br>
            And I knew you'd come back to me<br>
            You'd come back to me<br>
            And you'd come back to me<br>
            And you'd come back<br>
            <br>
            And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
            You put me on and said I was your favorite

            Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny<br>
            Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis<br>
            Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money<br>
            And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"<br>
            <br>
            The wedding was charming, if a little gauche<br>
            There's only so far new money goes<br>
            They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"<br>
            Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud<br>
            The doctor had told him to settle down<br>
            It must have been her fault his heart gave out<br>
            <br>
            And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
            Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been<br>
            There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen<br>
            She had a marvelous time ruining everything."<br>
            <br>
            Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever<br>
            Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city<br>
            Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names<br>
            And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet<br>
            And losing on card game bets with Dalí<br>
            <br>
            And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty<br>
            Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been<br>
            There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen<br>
            She had a marvelous time ruining everything."<br>
            <br>
            They say she was seen on occasion<br>
            Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea<br>
            And in a feud with her neighbor<br>
            She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green<br>
            Fifty years is a long time<br>
            Holiday House sat quietly on that beach<br>
            Free of women with madness<br>
            Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me<br>
            <br>
            Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been<br>
            There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen<br>
            I had a marvelous time ruining everything<br>
            I had a marvelous time<br>
            Ruining everything<br>
            A marvelous time<br>
            Ruining everything<br>
            A marvelous time<br>
            I had a marvelous time
