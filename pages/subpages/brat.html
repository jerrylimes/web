            I don't wanna share the space<br>
            I don't wanna force a smile<br>
            This one girl taps my insecurities<br>
            Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiralling<br>
            One voice tells me that they laugh<br>
            George says I'm just paranoid<br>
            Says he just don't see it, he's so naive<br>
            I'm embarrassed to have it but need the sympathy<br>
            <br>
            Coz I couldn't even be her if I tried<br>
            I'm opposite, I'm on the other side<br>
            I feel all these feelings I can't control<br>
            Oh no<br>
            Don't know why<br>
            All this sympathy is just a knife<br>

            Why I wanna buy a gun<br>
            Why I wanna shoot myself<br>
            Volatile at war with my dialogue<br>
            I'd say that there was a God if they could stop this<br>
            Wild voice tearing me apart<br>
            I'm so apprehensive now<br>
            Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriends show<br>
            Fingers crossed behind my back, I hope they break up quick<br>
            <br>
            Coz I couldn't even be her if I tried<br>

            Why is all this sympathy a fucking knife?<br>

            Wish you'd just talk to me<br>
            <br>
            I think you're getting closer<br>
            'Cause I've been getting nervous<br>
            I wish you'd talk, talk<br>
            Wish you'd talk, talk<br>
            Wish you'd talk, talk<br>
            Wish you'd just talk to me<br>
            Talk to me, talk to-<br>
            <br>
            Wish you'd just talk to me, talk to me, talk to-<br>
            Wish you'd just talk to me, talk to me, talk to-<br>
            Wish you'd just talk to me, talk to me, talk to-<br>
            Wish you'd just talk to me, talk to me, talk to-<br>
            <br>
            Talk to me in French, talk to me in Spanish<br>
            Talk to me in your own made-up language<br>
            Doesn't matter if I understand it<br>
            Talk right in my ear<br>
            Tell me your secrets and fears<br>
            Once you talk to me, I'll talk to you<br>
            And say, "Hey, let's get out of here<br>
            Shall we go back to my place?"
        </p>
