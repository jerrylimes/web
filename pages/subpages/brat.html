        This one girl taps my insecurities<br>
        Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiralling<br>
        One voice tells me that they laugh<br>
        George says I'm just paranoid<br>
        Says he just don't see it, he's so naive<br>
        I'm embarrassed to have it but need the sympathy<br>
        <br>
        Coz I couldn't even be her if I tried<br>
        I'm opposite, I'm on the other side<br>
        I feel all these feelings I can't control<br>
        Oh no<br>

        Volatile at war with my dialogue<br>
        I'd say that there was a God if they could stop this<br>
        Wild voice tearing me apart<br>
        I'm so apprehensive now<br>
        Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriends show<br>
        Fingers crossed behind my back, I hope they break up quick<br>

        Sometimes, I just wanna rewind<br>
        Sometimes (Sometimes, sometimes), I just wanna rewind<br>
        <br>
        I'd go back in time to when I wasn't insecure<br>
        To when I didn't over analyze my face shape<br>
        Nowadays I only eat at the good restaurants<br>
        But honestly I'm always thinking 'bout my weight<br>
        I used to never feel embarrassed<br>
        Feel embarrassed when I call up the paparazzi<br>
        Everyone else does it constantly<br>
        I hate these doubts that keep running through my mind<br>

        Sometimes (Sometimes, sometimes), I just wanna rewind<br>

        Used to burn CDs full of songs I didn't know<br>
        Used to sit in my bedroom putting polish on my toes<br>
        Recently, I've been thinking 'bout a way simpler time<br>
        Sometimes I really think it would be cool to rewind<br>
        <br>
        I used to never think about Billboard<br>
        But now I've started thinking again<br>
        Wondering 'bout whether I think I deserve commercial success<br>
        It's running through my mind<br>
        Sometimes I really think it would be cool to rewind<br>

        Always on my mind<br>
        Every day, every night<br>
        Your star burns so bright<br>
        Why did I push you away?<br>
        I was scared sometimes<br>
        You had a power like a lightning strike<br>
        When I'm on stage sometimes I lie<br>
        Say that I love singing these songs you left behind<br>
        And I know you always said, "It's okay to cry"<br>
        So I know I can cry, I can cry<br>
        So I cry<br>
        <br>
        Wish I'd tried to pull you closer<br>
        You pushed me hard made me focus<br>
        Your words, brutal, loving, truthful<br>
        I was petrified<br>
        You're a hero and a human<br>
        Track was done I'd make excuses<br>
        You'd say, "Come on, stay for dinner"<br>
        I'd say, "No, I'm fine"<br>
        Now I really wish I'd stayed<br>

        Guilty feelings keep me fractured<br>
        Got a phone call after Christmas<br>
        Didn't know how I should act<br>
        I watched you dance online<br>
        Your sounds, your words live on endless<br>
        When I make songs I remember<br>
        Things you'd suggest - "Make it faster!"<br>
        Would you like this one?<br>
        Maybe just a little bit<br>
        <br>
        Always on my mind<br>
        Every day, every night<br>
        Your star burns so bright<br>

        So we go eat at a restaurant<br>
        Sometimes it feels a bit awkward<br>
        Coz we don't have much in common<br>
        <br>
        People say we're alike<br>
        They say we've got the same hair<br>
        We talk about making music<br>
        But I don't know if it's honest<br>
        Can't tell if you wanna see me<br>
        Falling over and failing<br>

        But I'm about throwing parties<br>
        Think you should come to my party<br>
        And put your hands up<br>
        I think we're totally different<br>
        But opposites do attract<br>
        Maybe we're so meant to be<br>
        Just you and me<br>
        <br>
        Coz people say we're alike<br>
        They say we've got the same hair<br>
        One day we might make some music<br>
        The Internet would go crazy<br>
        But you might still wanna see me<br>
        Falling over and failing<br>
        At least we're closer to being<br>

        I guess the apple don't fall far from the tree<br>
        'Cause I've been looking at you so long now I only see me<br>
        I wanna throw the apple into the sky<br>
        Feels like you never understand me so I just want to drive<br>
        <br>
        To the airport<br>
        The airport<br>
        The airport<br>

        I guess the apple could turn yellow or green<br>
        I know there's lots of different nuances to you and to me<br>
        I wanna grow the apple, keep all the seeds<br>
        But I can't help but get so angry you don't listen, I leave<br>
        <br>

        I think the apple's rotten right to the core<br>
        From all the things passed down from all the apples coming before<br>
        I split the apple down symmetrical lines<br>
        And what I find is kind of scary, makes me just want to drive<br>
        <br>
        I wanna know where you go when you're feeling alone<br>

        I think about it all the time<br>
        That I might run out of time<br>
        But I finally met my baby<br>
        And a baby might be mine<br>
        'Cause maybe one day I might<br>
        If I don't run out of time<br>
        Would it give my life a new purpose?<br>
        <br>
        I was walking around in Stockholm, seriously thinking 'bout my future for the first time<br>
        It was ice cold<br>
        Playing demos on my iPhone<br>
        I went to my friend's place and I met their baby for the first time<br>
        How sublime<br>
        What a joy, oh my, oh my<br>
        Standing there<br>
        Same old clothes she wore before, holding her child, yeah<br>
        She's a radiant mother and he's a beautiful father<br>
        And now they both know these things that I don't<br>
        <br>
        I think about it all the time<br>
        That I might run out of time<br>
        But I finally met my baby<br>
        And a baby might be mine<br>
        'Cause maybe one day I might<br>
        If I don't run out of time<br>
        Would it make me miss all my freedom?<br>
        I think about it all the time<br>
        <br>
        I-I think about it all the time<br>
        That I might run out of time<br>
        But I finally met my baby<br>
        And a baby might be mine<br>
        'Cause maybe one day I might<br>
        If I don't run out of time<br>
        Would it give my life a new purpose?<br>
        I think about it all the time<br>
        <br>
        And they're exactly the same but they're different now<br>
        And I'm so scared I'm missing out on something<br>
        So, we had a conversation on the way home<br>
        Should I stop my birth control<br>
        'Cause my career feels so small in the existential scheme of it all<br>
        <br>
        I think about it all the time

        Man, I don't know. I'm just a girl (Girl, girl, girl, girl)<br>

        Yeah, I don't know if you like me<br>
        Sometimes I think you might hate me<br>
        Sometimes I think I might hate you<br>
        Maybe you just wanna be me<br>
        You always say, "Let's go out."<br>
        So we go eat at a restaurant<br>
        Sometimes it feels a bit awkward<br>
        'Cause we don't have much in common<br>
        <br>
        People say we're alike<br>
        They say we've got the same hair<br>
        We talk about making music<br>
        But I don't know if it's honest<br>
        Can't tell if you wanna see me<br>
        Falling over and failing<br>
        And you can't tell what you're feeling<br>
        I think I know how you feel<br>

        <br>
        Well, honestly, I was speechless<br>
        When I woke up to your voice note<br>
        You told me how you'd been feeling<br>
        Let's work it out on the remix<br>
        You'd always say, "Let's go out."<br>
        But then I'd cancel last minute<br>
        I was so lost in my head<br>
        And scared to be in your pictures<br>
        'Cause for the last couple years<br>
        I've been at war in my body<br>
        I tried to starve myself thinner<br>
        And then I gained all the weight back<br>
        I was trapped in the hatred<br>
        And your life seemed so awesome<br>
        I never thought for a second<br>
        My voice was in your head<br>
        <br>
        "Girl, you walk like a bitch"<br>
        When I was ten, someone said that<br>
        And it's just self-defence<br>
        Until you're building a weapon<br>
        She believed my projection<br>
        And now I totally get it<br>
        Forgot that inside the icon<br>

        It's you and me on the coin<br>
        The industry loves to spend<br>
        And when we put this to bed<br>
        The Internet will go crazy<br>
