        When the morning came, we<br>
        Were cleaning incense off your<br>
        Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again<br>
        Laughing with my feet in your lap<br>
        Like you were my closest friend<br>
        "How'd we end up on the floor anyway?"<br>
        You say<br>
        "Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top rosé<br>
        That's how"<br>
        I see you every day now<br>
        <br>
        And I chose you<br>
        The one I was dancing with in New York<br>
        No shoes<br>
        Looked up at the sky and it was<br>
        The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me<br>
        And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was<br>
        The mark they saw on my collarbone<br>
        The rust that grew between telephones<br>
        The lips I used to call home<br>
        So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
        <br>
        When the silence came, we<br>
        Were shaking blind and hazy<br>
        How the hell did we lose sight of us again?<br>
        Sobbing with your head in your hands<br>
        Ain't that the way shit always ends<br>
        You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway<br>
        Carnations you had thought were roses<br>
        That's us<br>
        I feel you, no matter what<br>
        The rubies that I gave up<br>
        <br>
        And I lost you<br>
        The one I was dancing with in New York<br>
        No shoes<br>
        Looked up at the sky and it was maroon<br>
        The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me<br>
        And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was<br>
        The mark they saw on my collarbone<br>
        The rust that grew between telephones<br>
        The lips I used to call home<br>
        So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
        <br>
        And I wake with your memory over me<br>
        That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy<br>
        (It was maroon)<br>
        And I wake with your memory over me<br>
        That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave<br>
        <br>
        The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me<br>
        And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet<br>
        It was maroon<br>
        The mark they saw on my collarbone<br>
        The rust that grew between telephones<br>
        The lips I used to call home<br>
        So scarlet, it was maroon<br>
        <br>
        It was maroon<br>
        It was maroon

        I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser<br>
        Midnights become my afternoons<br>
        When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people<br>
        I've ghosted stand there in the room<br>
        <br>
        I should not be left to my own devices<br>
        They come with prices and vices<br>
        I end up in crisis<br>
        (Tale as old as time)<br>
        I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
        One day, I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
        'Cause you got tired of my scheming<br>
        (For the last time)<br>
        <br>
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        At teatime, everybody agrees<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby<br>
        And I'm a monster on the hill<br>
        Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city<br>
        Pierced through the heart, but never killed<br>
        <br>
        Did you hear my covert narcissism<br>
        I disguise as altruism<br>
        Like some kind of congressman?<br>
        (A tale as old as time)<br>
        I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
        One day, I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
        And life will lose all its meaning<br>
        (For the last time)<br>
        <br>
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
        At teatime, everybody agrees<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
        <br>
        I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money<br>
        She thinks I left them in the will<br>
        The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out<br>
        "She's laughing up at us from Hell"<br>
        <br>
        It's me, hi<br>
        I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        It's me, hi<br>
        I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        It's me, hi<br>
        Everybody agrees, everybody agrees<br>
        <br>
        It's me, hi (Hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
        At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

        One night a few moons ago<br>
        I saw flecks of what could've been lights<br>
        But it might just have been you<br>
        Passing by unbeknownst to me<br>
        Life is emotionally abusive<br>
        And time can't stop me quite like you did<br>
        And my flight was awful, thanks for asking<br>
        I'm unglued, thanks to you<br>
        <br>
        And it's like snow at the beach<br>
        Weird, but fuckin' beautiful<br>
        Flying in a dream<br>
        Stars by the pocketful<br>
        You wanting me tonight, feels impossible<br>
        But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around<br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        <br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        Like snow, oh<br>
        <br>
        This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen<br>
        I searched 'aurora borealis green'<br>
        I've never seen someone lit from within<br>
        Blurring out my periphery<br>
        My smile is like I won a contest<br>
        And to hide that would be so dishonest<br>
        And it's fine to fake it till you make it<br>
        Till you do<br>
        Till it's true<br>
        <br>
        Now it's like snow at the beach<br>
        Weird, but fuckin' beautiful<br>
        Flying in a dream<br>
        Stars by the pocketful<br>
        You wanting me tonight, feels impossible<br>
        But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around<br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        <br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        Like snow, oh<br>
        <br>
        I can't speak, afraid to jinx it<br>
        I don't even dare to wish it<br>
        But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet<br>
        Now I'm all for you like Janet<br>
        Can this be a real thing, can it?<br>
        <br>
        Are we falling like<br>
        Snow at the beach<br>
        Weird, but fuckin' beautiful<br>
        Flying in a dream<br>
        Stars by the pocketful<br>
        You wanting me tonight, feels impossible<br>
        But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around<br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        Like snow<br>
        But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around<br>
        <br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        (It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)<br>
        Like snow on the beach<br>
        (It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)<br>

        Summer went away<br>
        Still the yearning stays<br>
        I play it cool with the best of them<br>
        I wait patiently<br>
        He's gonna notice me<br>
        It's okay, we're the best of friends<br>
        Anyway<br>
        <br>
        I hear it in your voice<br>
        You're smoking with your boys<br>
        I touch my phone as if it's your face<br>
        I didn't choose this town<br>
        I dream of getting out<br>
        There's just one who could make me stay<br>
        All my days<br>
        <br>
        From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
        I waited ages to see you there<br>
        I search the party of better bodies<br>
        Just to learn that you never cared<br>
        You're on your own, kid<br>
        You always have been<br>
        <br>
        I see the great escape<br>
        So long, Daisy May<br>
        I picked the petals, he loves me not<br>
        Something different bloomed<br>
        Writing in my room<br>
        I play my songs in the parking lot<br>
        I'll run away<br>
        <br>
        From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
        I called a taxi to take me there<br>
        I search the party of better bodies<br>
        Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare<br>
        You're on your own, kid<br>
        You always have been<br>
        <br>
        From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes<br>
        I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this<br>
        I hosted parties and starved my body<br>
        Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss<br>
        The jokes weren't funny, I took the money<br>
        My friends from home don't know what to say<br>
        I looked around in a blood-soaked gown<br>
        And I saw something they can't take away<br>
        'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned<br>
        Everything you lose is a step you take<br>
        So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it<br>
        You've got no reason to be afraid<br>
        <br>
        You're on your own, kid<br>
        Yeah, you can face this<br>
        You're on your own, kid<br>
        You always have been
