        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        Dearest, darlingest Momsie and Popsicle<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        My dear father<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda &amp; Elphaba:]</i><br>
        There's been some confusion over rooming here at Shiz<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        But of course, I'll care for Nessa<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        But of course, I'll rise above it<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda &amp; Elphaba:]</i><br>
        For I know that's how you'd want me to respond<br>
        Yes<br>
        There's been some confusion for, you see, my roommate is<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        Unusually and exceedingly peculiar<br>
        And altogether quite impossible to describe<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        Blonde<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        What is this feeling, so sudden and new?<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        I felt the moment I laid eyes on you<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        My pulse is rushing<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        My head is reeling<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        Yeah, well, my face is flushing<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda &amp; Elphaba:]</i><br>
        What is this feeling?<br>
        Fervid as a flame<br>
        Does it have a name?<br>
        Yes<br>
        Loathing<br>
        Unadulterated loathing<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        For your face<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        Your voice<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        Your clothing<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda &amp; Elphaba:]</i><br>
        Let's just say<br>
        I loathe it all<br>
        Every little trait, however small<br>
        Makes my very flesh begin to crawl<br>
        With simple, utter loathing<br>
        There's a strange exhilaration<br>
        In such total detestation<br>
        It's so pure, so strong<br>
        Though I do admit, it came on fast<br>
        Still, I do believe that it can last<br>
        And I will be loathing<br>
        Loathing you my whole life long<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Shiz students:]</i><br>
        Dear Galinda, you are just too good<br>
        How do you stand it? I don't think I could<br>
        She's a terror, she's a tartar, we don't mean to show a bias<br>
        But, Galinda, you're a martyr<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        Well, these things are sent to try us<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Shiz students:]</i><br>
        Poor Galinda, forced to reside<br>
        With someone so disgusticified<br>
        We just want to tell you, we're all on your side<br>
        We share your loathing<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda &amp; Elphaba:]</i><br>
        What is this feeling, so sudden and new?<br>

        I felt the moment I laid eyes on you<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Shiz students:]</i><br>
        For her face, her voice, her clothing<br>
        <br>

        We loathe it all<br>
        <br>

        Oh, what is this feeling?<br>
        <br>

        Every little trait, however small<br>

        Does it have a name?<br>
        <br>

        Makes our very flesh begin to crawl<br>
        <br>

        Yes<br>

    <p id="text-n">
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        Elphie, now that we're friends, I've decided to make you my new project<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        Oh, you really don't have to do that<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        I know!<br>
        That's what makes me so nice<br>
        <br>
        Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I<br>
        And let's face it, right? Who isn't less fortunate than I?<br>
        My tender heart tends to start to bleed<br>
        And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over<br>
        I know, I know exactly what they need<br>
        And even in your case<br>
        Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face<br>
        Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed<br>
        Follow my lead<br>
        And yes, indeed<br>
        You will be<br>
        Popular<br>
        You're gonna be popular<br>
        I'll teach you the proper ploys when you talk to boys<br>
        Little ways to flirt and flounce, ooh!<br>
        I'll show you what shoes to wear, how to fix your hair<br>
        Everything that really counts to be<br>
        Popular<br>
        I'll help you be popular<br>
        You'll hang with the right cohorts, you'll be good at sports<br>
        Know the slang you've got to know<br>
        So let's start 'cause you've got an awfully long way to go<br>
        Don't be offended by my frank analysis<br>
        Think of it as personality dialysis<br>
        Now that I've chosen to become a pal<br>
        A sister and adviser, there's nobody wiser<br>
        Not when it comes to<br>
        Popular<br>
        I know about popular<br>
        And with an assist from me to be who you'll be<br>
        Instead of dreary who-you-were<br>
        <br>
        Well, are!<br>
        <br>
        There's nothing that can stop you from becoming populer... —lar!<br>
        <br>
        La-la, la-la<br>
        We're gonna make you popular<br>
        When I see depressing creatures<br>
        With unprepossessing features<br>
        I remind them on their own behalf to think of<br>
        Celebrated heads of state<br>
        Or especially great communicators<br>
        Did they have brains or knowledge?<br>
        Don't make me laugh<br>
        They were<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        Popular<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Galinda:]</i><br>
        Right!<br>
        <br>
        It's all about popular<br>
        It's not about aptitude, it's the way you're viewed<br>
        So it's very shrewd to be<br>
        Very, very popular like me, me<br>
        And though you protest<br>
        Your disinterest<br>
        I know clandestinely<br>
        You're gonna grin and bear it, your newfound popularity<br>
        Woo!<br>
        La-la, la-la<br>
        La-la, la-la<br>
        La-la, ooh<br>
        You'll be popular<br>
        Just not quite as popular as me

        Elphaba<br>
        Why couldn't you have stayed calm for once<br>
        Instead of flying off the handle?<br>
        I hope you're happy<br>
        <br>
        I hope you're happy now<br>
        I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever<br>
        I hope you think you're clever<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        I hope you're happy<br>

        I hope you're happy too<br>
        I hope you're proud how you would<br>
        Grovel in submission to feed your own ambition<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Glinda &amp; Elphaba:]</i><br>
        So though I can't imagine how<br>
        I hope you're happy right now<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Glinda:]</i><br>
        Elphie, listen to me<br>
        Just say you're sorry<br>
        <br>
        You can still be with the Wizard<br>
        What you've worked and waited for<br>
        You can have all you ever wanted<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        I know<br>
        <br>
        But I don't want it<br>
        No, I can't want it anymore<br>
        <br>
        Something has changed within me<br>
        Something is not the same<br>
        I'm through with playing by<br>
        The rules of someone else's game<br>
        Too late for second-guessing<br>
        Too late to go back to sleep<br>
        It's time to trust my instincts<br>
        Close my eyes, and leap<br>
        <br>
        It's time to try defying gravity<br>
        I think I'll try defying gravity<br>
        And you can't pull me down<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Glinda:]</i><br>
        Can't I make you understand<br>
        You're having delusions of grandeur?<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Elphaba:]</i><br>
        I'm through accepting limits<br>
        'Cause someone says they're so<br>
        Some things I cannot change<br>
        But 'til I try, I'll never know<br>
        Too long I've been afraid of<br>
        Losing love, I guess I've lost<br>
        Well, if that's love<br>
        It comes at much too high a cost<br>
        <br>
        I'd sooner buy defying gravity<br>
        Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity<br>
        And you can't pull me down<br>
        <br>
        Come with me<br>
        Think of what we could do together<br>
        <br>
        Unlimited<br>
        Together, we're unlimited<br>

        There's no fight we cannot win<br>

        "Everyone deserves the chance to fly"<br>
        And if I'm flying solo<br>
        At least, I'm flying free<br>
        To those who'd ground me<br>
        Take a message back from me<br>
        <br>
        Tell them how I'm defying gravity<br>
        I'm flying high, defying gravity<br>
