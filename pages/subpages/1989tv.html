    <p id="dev-cal-2"><i>The following texts are from Taylor's tweet.</i><br><br> I was born in 1989, reinvented for The
        first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with The re-release of This album I love so dearly.
        Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine The magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long. <br>This
        moment is a reflection of The woods we've wandered Through and all This love between us still glowing in the
        dark. <br>I present you wiTh gratitude and wlid wonder, my version of 1989. <br>It's been waiting for
        you.<br><br></p>

        Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard<br>
        Clink, clink, being this young is art<br>
        Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool<br>

        <br>
        Got love-struck, went straight to my head<br>

        Handprints in wet cement<br>
        Adorned with smoke on my clothes<br>
        Lovelorn and nobody knows<br>

        Send the code, he's waitin' there<br>
        The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air<br>
        Everyone wants him, that was my crime<br>
        The wrong place at the right time<br>
        And I break down, then he's pullin' me in<br>
        In a world of boys, he's a gentleman<br>

        In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury<br>
        You're not sayin' you're in love with me<br>
        But you're going to<br>
        Half awake, takin' your chances<br>
        It's a big mistake, I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"<br>

        I've known it from the very start<br>
        We're a shot in the darkest dark<br>
        Oh no, oh no<br>
        I'm unarmed<br>
        The waiting is a sadness<br>
        Fading into madness<br>
        Oh no, oh no<br>
        It won't stop<br>
        <br>
        I'm standing on a tightrope, alone<br>
        I hold my breath a little bit longer<br>
        Halfway out the door, but it won't close<br>
        I'm holding out hope for you to say, "Don't go"<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to lead me on?<br>
        Why'd you have to twist the knife?<br>
        Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding<br>
        Why'd you whisper in the dark<br>
        Just to leave me in the night?<br>
        Now your silence has me screaming, screaming<br>
        Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        Say, say, say, say<br>
        <br>
        Now I'm pacing on shaky ground<br>
        Strike a match, then you blow it out<br>
        Oh no, oh no<br>
        It's not fair<br>
        'Cause you kiss me and it stops time<br>
        And I'm yours, but you're not mine<br>
        Oh no, oh no<br>
        You're not there<br>
        <br>
        I'm standing on the sidewalk, alone<br>
        I wait for you to drive by<br>
        I was trying to see the cards that you won't show<br>
        I'm about to fold unless you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        Oh-ah<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to lead me on?<br>
        Why'd you have to twist the knife?<br>
        Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding<br>
        Why'd you whisper in the dark<br>
        Just to leave me in the night?<br>
        Now your silence has me screaming, screaming<br>
        Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        Say, say, say, say<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to make me want you? (Why'd you have to make me want you?)<br>
        Why'd you have to give me nothing back? (Why'd you have to)<br>
        Why'd you have to make me love you? (Why'd you have to make me love you?)<br>
        I said, "I love you," you say nothing back (I said, "I love you")<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to lead me on?<br>
        Why'd you have to twist the knife?<br>
        Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding<br>
        Why'd you whisper in the dark<br>
        Just to leave me in the night?<br>
        Now your silence has me screaming, screaming<br>
        Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")<br>
        Say, say, say, say<br>
        <br>
        I want you more<br>
        But you won't<br>
        But you won't<br>
        I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"<br>
        But you won't<br>
        But you won't<br>
        But you won't

    <p id="dev-cal-2">
        You went to a party, I heard from everybody<br>
        You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started<br>
        Did you get anxious though, on the way home?<br>
        I guess I'll never, ever know<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        You grew your hair long, you got new icons<br>
        And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on<br>
        I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change<br>
        But I guess I don't have a say<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        I called my mom, she said that it was for the best<br>
        Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less<br>
        I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost<br>
        And what it cost<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        What do you tell your friends we<br>
        Shared dinners, long weekends with?<br>
        Truth is, I can't pretend it's<br>
        Platonic, it's just ended, so<br>
        <br>
        I called my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)<br>
        Remind myself the way you faded till I left (Till I left)<br>
        I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (What I lost)<br>
        And what it cost<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        I don't have to pretend I like acid rock<br>
        Or that I'd like to be on a mega-yacht<br>
        With important men who think important thoughts<br>
        Guess maybe I am better off<br>
        Now that we don't talk<br>
        <br>
        And the only way back to my dignity<br>
        Was to turn into a shrouded mystery<br>
        Just like I had been when you were chasing me<br>
        Guess this is how it has to be<br>
        Now that we don't talk

        You had people who called you on unmarked numbers<br>
        In my peripheral vision<br>
        I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer<br>
        All was quickly forgiven<br>
        You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious<br>
        Flush with the currency of cool<br>
        I was always turning out my empty pockets<br>
        And when it came to you<br>
        <br>
        I didn't come here to make friends<br>
        We were born to be suburban legends<br>
        When you hold me, it holds me together<br>
        And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever<br>
        <br>
        I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs<br>
        Would surprise the whole school<br>
        When I ended up back at our class reunion<br>
        Walking in with you<br>
        You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries<br>
        With the pages ripped out<br>
        I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium<br>
        And I can still see you now<br>
        <br>
        I didn't come here to make friends<br>
        We were born to be suburban legends<br>
        When you hold me, it holds me together<br>
        And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever<br>
        <br>
        I know that you still remember<br>
        We were born to be national treasures<br>
        When you told me we'd get back together<br>
        And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever<br>
        <br>
        Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block<br>
        I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it<br>
        Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door<br>
        You don't knock anymore, and my whole life's ruined<br>
        <br>

        You don't knock anymore, and I always knew it<br>
        And my life had been ruined

        Once the flight had flown<br>
        With the wilt of the rose<br>
        I slept all alone<br>
        You still wouldn't go<br>
        <br>
        Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later<br>
        I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters<br>
        You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor<br>
        You search in every maiden's bed for something greater<br>
        <br>
        Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?<br>
        Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?<br>
        "Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out<br>
        Baby, was it over then?<br>
        And is it over now?<br>
        <br>
        When you lost control<br>
        Red blood, white snow<br>
        Blue dress on a boat<br>
        Your new girl is my clone<br>
        <br>
        And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights<br>
        At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight<br>
        Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs<br>
        Oh Lord, I think about jumping<br>
        Off of very tall somethings<br>
        Just to see you come running<br>
        And say the one thing I've been wanting<br>
        But no!<br>
        <br>
        Let's fast forward to 300 awkward blind dates later<br>
        If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her<br>
        You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor<br>
        You search in every model's bed for something greater<br>
        <br>
        Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?<br>
        Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?<br>
        "Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out<br>
        Baby, was it over then?<br>

        Oh Lord, I think about jumping<br>

        And say the one thing I've been wanting<br>
        But no!<br>
        <br>
        (Flashing lights, oh Lord) Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later<br>
        (Flashing lights) I was hoping you'd be there<br>
        And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no (Oh Lord, oh Lord)
