        (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
        <br>
        <span style="color: #F5B8AE;">
            Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br>
            You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
            Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price<br>
            You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
            <br>
            Killing me slow, out the window<br>
            I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below<br>
            Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
            What doesn't kill me makes me want you more<br>
            <br>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #F0ADB4;">
            And it's new, the shape of your body<br>
            It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
            And it's ooh, whoa oh<br>
            It's a cruel summer<br>
            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
            No rules in breakable heaven<br>
            But ooh, whoa oh<br>
            It's a cruel summer<br>
            With you<br>
            <br>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #F0ACDD;">
            Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine<br>
            I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
            We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br>
            We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)<br>
            <br>
            So cut the headlights, summer's a knife<br>
            I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<br>
            Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
            And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know<br>
            <br>
        </span>
        <span style="color: #E4ADF0;">
            Oh, it's new, the shape of your body<br>
            It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
            And it's ooh, whoa oh<br>
            It's a cruel summer<br>
            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
            No rules in breakable heaven<br>

            <i>Alright, Los Angeles, we have arrived at the very first bridge of the evening. Now, I have a
                question:
                <br>Does anyone here know the lyrics to this bridge?
                <br>Prove it! <br><br>
            </i>
            I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
            And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)<br>
            Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true<br>
            I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
            And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
            Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)<br>
            And I scream, "For whatever it's worth<br>
            I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"<br>
            He looks up, grinning like a devil<br>
