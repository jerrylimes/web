        <p id="dev-cal-2">
            <i>At this hearing<br>
                I stand before my fellow members<br>
                of the Tortured Poets Department<br>
                With a summary of my findings<br>
                A debrief, a detailed rewinding<br>
                For the purpose of warning<br>
                For the sake of reminding<br>
                As you might all unfortunately recall<br>
                I had been struck with a case<br>
                of a restricted humanity<br>
                Which explains my plea here today<br>
                of temporary insanity<br>
                You see, the pendulum swings<br>
                Oh, the chaos it brings<br>
                Leads the caged beast to do<br>
                the most curious things<br>
                <br>
                Lovers spend years denying what’s ill fated<br>
                Resentment rotting away<br>
                galaxies we created<br>
                Stars placed and glued<br>
                meticulously by hand<br>
                next to the ceiling fan<br>
                Tried wishing on comets.<br>
                Tried dimming the shine.<br>
                Tried to orbit his planet.<br>
                Some stars never align.<br>
                <br>
                And in one conversation, I tore down the whole sky<br>
                Spring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues<br>
                Then a crash from the skylight<br>
                Bursting through<br>
                Something old, someone hallowed,<br>
                who told me he could be brand new<br>
                And so I was out of the oven<br>
                And into the microwave<br>
                Out of the slammer and into a tidal wave<br>
                How gallant to save the empress<br>
                from her gilded tower<br>
                Swinging a sword he could barely lift<br>
                But loneliness struck at that fateful hour<br>
                Low hanging fruit on his wine stained lips<br>
                He never even scratched the surface<br>
                of me.<br>
                None of them did.<br>
                <br>
                “In summation, it was not a love affair!”<br>
                I screamed while bringing my fists<br>
                to my coffee ringed desk<br>
                It was a mutual manic phase.<br>
                It was self harm.<br>
                It was house and then cardiac arrest.<br>
                A smirk creeps onto this poet’s face<br>
                Because it’s the worst men that I write best.<br>
                <br>
                And so I enter into evidence<br>
                My tarnished coat of arms<br>
                My muses, acquired like bruises<br>
                My talismans and charms<br>
                The tick, tick, tick of love bombs<br>
                My veins of pitch black ink<br>
                All’s fair in love and poetry<br>
                <br>
                Sincerely,<br>
                The Chairman<br>
                of The Tortured Poets Department</i>

            I was supposed to be sent away, but they forgot to come and get me<br>
            I was a functioning alcoholic till nobody noticed my new aesthetic<br>
            All of this to say, I hope you're okay, but you're the reason<br>
            And no one here's to blame, but what about your quiet treason?<br>
            <br>
            And for a fortnight there, we were forever<br>
            Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather<br>
            Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors<br>
            Your wife waters flowers<br>
            I wanna kill her<br>
            <br>
            All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February<br>
            I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary<br>
            <br>
            And I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
            I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
            I touched you for only a fortnight<br>
            I touched you<br>
            But I touched you<br>
            <br>
            And for a fortnight there, we were forever<br>

            I wanna kill her<br>
            <br>
            And for a fortnight there, we were together<br>
            Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater<br>
            Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors<br>
            My husband is cheating<br>
            I wanna kill him<br>
            <br>
            I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
            I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
            I touched you for only a fortnight<br>
            I touched you<br>
            I touched you<br>

            I love you, it's ruining my life<br>
            I love you, it's ruining my life<br>

            I touched you<br>
            I touched you<br>
            <br>
            Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up<br>
            Another fortnight lost in America<br>
            Move to Florida, buy the car you want<br>
            But it won't start up till you touch, touch, touch me<br>
            <br>

            You left your typewriter at my apartment<br>
            Straight from the Tortured Poets Department<br>
            I think some things I never say<br>
            Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?" But<br>
            You're in self-sabotage mode, throwing spikes down on the road<br>
            But I've seen this episode and still loved the show<br>
            Who else decodes you?<br>
            <br>
            And who's gonna hold you like me?<br>
            And who's gonna know you, if not me?<br>
            I laughed in your face and said<br>
            "You're not Dylan Thomas<br>
            I'm not Patti Smith<br>
            This ain't the Chelsea Hotel<br>
            We're modern idiots"<br>
            And who's gonna hold you like me?<br>
            Nobody<br>
            No-fucking-body<br>
            Nobody<br>
            <br>
            You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate<br>
            We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist<br>
            I scratch your head, you fall asleep<br>
            Like a tattooed golden retriever<br>
            But you awaken with dread, pounding nails in your head<br>
            But I've read this one where you come undone<br>
            I chose this cyclone with you<br>
            <br>
            And who's gonna hold you like me? (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)<br>
            And who's gonna know you like me? (Who's gonna know you?)<br>
            I laughed in your face and said<br>
            "You're not Dylan Thomas<br>
            I'm not Patti Smith<br>
            This ain't the Chelsea Hotel<br>
            We're modern idiots"<br>
            And who's gonna hold you like me? (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)<br>
            No-fucking-body (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)<br>
            Nobody (Who's gonna hold you? Gonna love you? Gonna troll you?)<br>
            Nobody<br>
            <br>
            Sometimes I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me<br>
            But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave<br>
            And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen<br>
            Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be<br>
            'Cause we're crazy<br>
            So tell me<br>
            Who else is gonna know me?<br>
            At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger and put it on the one<br>
            People put wedding rings on, and that's the closest I've come<br>
            To my heart exploding<br>
            <br>
            Who's gonna hold you?<br>
            Me<br>
            Who's gonna know you?<br>
            Me<br>
            "And you're not Dylan Thomas<br>
            I'm not Patti Smith<br>
            This ain't the Chelsea Hotel<br>
            We're two idiots"<br>
            Who's gonna hold you?<br>
            <br>
            Who's gonna hold you? (Who's gonna hold you?)<br>
            Who's gonna hold you? (Who's gonna hold you?)<br>
            Who's gonna hold you?<br>

            Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?<br>
            <br>
            You left your typewriter at my apartment<br>
            Straight from the Tortured Poets Department<br>

            Oh, here we go again<br>
            The voices in his head<br>
            Called the rain to end our days of wild<br>
            The sickest army doll<br>
            Purchased at the mall<br>
            Rivulets descend my plastic smile<br>
            <br>
            But you should've seen him<br>
            When he first got me<br>
            <br>
            My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh<br>
            I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh<br>
            'Cause it fit too right<br>
            Puzzle pieces in the dead of night<br>
            I should've known it was a matter of time<br>
            Oh, oh, my boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
            <br>
            There was a litany of reasons why<br>
            We could've played for keeps this time<br>
            I know I'm just repeating myself<br>
            Put me back on my shelf<br>
            But first, pull the string<br>
            And I'll tell you that he runs<br>
            Because he loves me (He loves me)<br>
            <br>
            'Cause you should've seen him<br>
            When he first saw me<br>
            <br>
            My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh<br>
            I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh<br>
            'Cause I knew too much<br>
            There was danger in the heat of my touch<br>
            He saw forever so he smashed it up<br>
            Oh, oh, my boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
            <br>
            Once I fix me, he's gonna miss me<br>
            Once I fix me, he's gonna miss me<br>
            <br>
            Just say when, I'd play again<br>
            He was my best friend<br>
            Down at the sandlot<br>
            I felt more when we played pretend<br>
            Than with all the Kens<br>
            'Cause he took me out of my box<br>
            Stole my tortured heart<br>
            Left all these broken parts<br>
            Told me I'm better off<br>
            But I'm not<br>
            I'm not<br>
            I'm not

            So long, London (So long, London)<br>
            <br>
            I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist<br>
            I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift<br>
            Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away<br>
            My spine split from carrying us up the hill<br>
            Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill<br>
            I stopped trying to make him laugh, stopped trying to drill the safe<br>
            Thinking how much sad did you think I had<br>
            Did you think I had in me?<br>
            Oh, the tragedy<br>
            <br>
            So long, London<br>
            You'll find someone<br>
            <br>
            I didn't opt in to be your odd man out<br>
            I founded the club she's heard great things about<br>
            I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath<br>
            I stopped CPR, after all, it's no use<br>
            The spirit was gone, we would never come to<br>
            And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free<br>
            <br>
            For so long, London<br>
            Stitches undone<br>
            Two graves, one gun<br>
            I'll find someone<br>
            <br>
            And you say I abandoned the ship<br>
            But I was going down with it<br>
            My white-knuckle dying grip<br>
            Holding tight to your quiet resentment<br>
            And my friends said it isn't right to be scared<br>
            Every day of a love affair<br>
            Every breath feels like rarest air<br>
            When you're not sure if he wants to be there<br>
            So how much sad did you think I had<br>
            Did you think I had in me?<br>
            How much tragedy?<br>
            Just how low did you think I'd go<br>
            Before I'd self-implode?<br>
            Before I'd have to go be free?<br>
            <br>
            You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?<br>
            I died on the altar waiting for the proof<br>
            You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days<br>
            And I'm just getting color back into my face<br>
            I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place<br>
            <br>
            For so long, London (So long, London)<br>
            Had a good run (Had a good run)<br>

        <p id="dev-cal-2">
            I forget how the West was won<br>
            I forget if this was ever fun<br>
            I just learned these people only raise you to cage you<br>
            Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best<br>
            Clutching their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"<br>
            I just learned these people try and save you<br>
            'Cause they hate you<br>
            <br>
            Too high a horse<br>
            For a simple girl to rise above it<br>
            They slammed the door on my whole world<br>
            The one thing I wanted<br>
            <br>
            Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned<br>
            Screaming, "But Daddy, I love him!<br>
            I'm having his baby"<br>
            No, I'm not, but you should see your faces<br>
            I'm telling him to floor it through the fences<br>
            No, I'm not coming to my senses<br>
            I know he's crazy but he's the one I want<br>
            <br>
            Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid<br>
            Tendrils tucked into a woven braid<br>
            Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all<br>
            He was chaos, he was revelry<br>
            Bedroom eyes like a remedy<br>
            Soon enough the elders had convened<br>
            Down at the city hall<br>
            <br>
            "Stay away from her"<br>
            The saboteurs protested too much<br>
            Lord knows the words we never heard<br>
            Just screeching tires and true love<br>
            <br>
            And I'm running with my dress unbuttoned<br>
            Screaming, "But Daddy, I love him!<br>
            I'm having his baby"<br>
            No, I'm not, but you should see your faces<br>
            I'm telling him to floor it through the fences<br>
            No, I'm not coming to my senses<br>
            I know he's crazy but he's the one I want<br>
            <br>
            I'll tell you something right now<br>
            I'd rather burn my whole life down<br>
            Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning<br>
            I'll tell you something about my good name<br>
            It's mine alone to disgrace<br>
            I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing<br>
            <br>
            God save the most judgmental creeps<br>
            Who say they want what's best for me<br>
            Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see<br>
            Thinking it can change the beat<br>
            Of my heart when he touches me<br>
            And counteract the chemistry<br>
            And undo the destiny<br>
            You ain't gotta pray for me<br>
            Me and my wild boy and all this wild joy<br>
            If all you want is gray for me<br>
            Then it's just white noise<br>
            And it's just my choice<br>
            <br>
            There's a lot of people in town that I<br>
            Bestow upon my fakest smiles<br>
            Scandal does funny things to pride<br>
            But brings lovers closer<br>
            We came back when the heat died down<br>
            Went to my parents and they came around<br>
            All the wine moms are still holding out<br>
            But fuck 'em, it's over<br>
            <br>
            Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun, and<br>
            Even my daddy just loves him<br>
            I'm his lady<br>
            And oh my God, you should see your faces<br>
            Time, doesn't it give some perspective?<br>
            And no, you can't come to the wedding<br>
            I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want<br>
            <br>
            I'll tell you something right now, you ain't gotta pray for me<br>
            Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy<br>
            He was chaos, he was revelry<br>
            If all you want is gray for me<br>
            Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice<br>
            <br>
            Screaming, "But Daddy, I love him!<br>
            I'm having his baby"<br>
            No, I'm not, but you<br>
            Should see your faces<br>
            But oh my God, you should see your faces<br>
            He was chaos, he was revelry

            Another summer, takin' cover<br>
            Rollin' thunder, he don't understand me<br>
            Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter<br>
            He was with her in dreams<br>
            Gray and blue and fights and tunnels<br>
            Handcuffed to the spell I was under<br>
            For just one hour of sunshine<br>
            Years of labor, locks and ceilings<br>
            In the shade of how he was feelin'<br>

            Camera flashes, welcome bashes<br>
            Get the matches, toss the ashes off the ledge<br>
            As I said in my letters, now that I know better<br>
            I will never lose my baby again<br>
            My friends tried but I wouldn't hear it<br>
            Watched me daily disappearing<br>
            For just one glimpse of his smile<br>
            All those nights you kept me going<br>
            Swirled you into all of my poems<br>
            Now we're at the starting line, I did my time<br>
            <br>
            Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'<br>
            To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams<br>
            To the one who says I'm the girl of his American Dreams<br>
            And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway<br>
            Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up, now that I know what's at stake<br>
            Here<br>
            At the park where we used to sit on children's swings<br>
            Wearing imaginary rings<br>
            But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

            You can beat the heat<br>
            If you beat the charges too<br>
            They said I was a cheat<br>
            I guess it must be true<br>
            And my friends all smell like weed or little babies<br>
            And this city reeks of driving myself crazy<br>
            <br>
            Little did you know, your home's really only a town you're just a guest in<br>
            So you work your life away just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin<br>
            <br>
            Florida!<br>
            Is one hell of a drug<br>

            <br>
            And the hurricane with my name, when it came<br>
            I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away<br>
            Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine<br>
            Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time<br>
            Yes, I'm haunted, but I'm feeling just fine<br>
            All my girls got their lace and their crimes<br>
            And your cheating husband disappeared, well<br>
            No one asks any questions here<br>
            So I did my best to lay to rest<br>
            All of the bodies that have ever been on my body<br>
            And in my mind, they sink into the swamp<br>
            Is that a bad thing to say in a song?<br>
            <br>
            Little did you know, your home's really only the town you'll get arrested<br>

            I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida<br>
            Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable<br>
            At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida!<br>

            Drowning in the Blue Nile<br>
            He sent me "Downtown Lights"<br>
            I hadn't heard it in a while<br>
            My boredom's bone-deep<br>
            This cage was once just fine<br>
            Am I allowed to cry?<br>
            <br>
            I dream of cracking locks<br>
            Throwing my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks<br>
            Crashing into him tonight, he's a paradox<br>
            I'm seeing visions, am I bad?<br>
            Or mad? Or wise?<br>
            <br>
            What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?<br>
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze<br>
            Oh, what a way to die<br>
            I keep recalling things we never did<br>
            Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trysts<br>
            Without ever touching his skin<br>
            How can I be guilty as sin?<br>
            <br>
            I keep these longings locked<br>
            In lowercase, inside a vault<br>
            Someone told me there's no such thing as bad thoughts<br>
            Only your actions talk<br>
            <br>
            These fatal fantasies giving way to labored breath<br>
            Taking all of me, we've already done it in my head<br>
            If it's make-believe<br>
            Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?<br>
            <br>
            What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?<br>
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze<br>
            Oh, what a way to die<br>
            My bedsheets are ablaze, I've screamed his name<br>
            Building up like waves crashing over my grave<br>
            Without ever touching his skin<br>
            How can I be guilty as sin?<br>
            <br>
            What if I roll the stone away?<br>
            They're gonna crucify me anyway<br>
            What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?<br>
            If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me<br>
            They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly<br>
            I choose you and me religiously<br>
            <br>
            What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?<br>
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze<br>

            You don't get to tell me about "sad"<br>
            <br>
            If you wanted me dead<br>
            You should've just said<br>
            Nothing makes me feel more alive<br>

            Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one more joke<br>
            Then we could all just laugh until I cry<br>

            You should be, you should be, you should be (You should be, you should be)<br>

            So tell me everything is not about me<br>
            But what if it is?<br>
            Then say they didn't do it to hurt me<br>
            But what if they did?<br>
            I want to snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me<br>
            You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me<br>
            So all you kids can sneak into my house, with all the cobwebs<br>
            I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?<br>
            <br>
            That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn<br>
            That I'm fearsome, and I'm wretched, and I'm wrong<br>
            Put narcotics into all of my songs<br>
            And that's why you're still singing along<br>

            'Cause you lured me, and you hurt me, and you taught me (You should be, you should be)<br>
            You caged me, and then you called me crazy<br>
            I am what I am 'cause you trained me<br>

            If we know the steps anyway?<br>

            Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"<br>
            I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"<br>
            I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed<br>

            Who's gonna tell me the truth, when you blew in with the winds of fate<br>
            And told me I reformed you?<br>
            When your Impressionist paintings of Heaven turned out to be fakes<br>
            Well, you took me to hell too<br>
            And all at once, the ink bleeds<br>
            A conman sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme<br>
            But I felt a hole like this<br>

            Still alive, killing time at the cemetery<br>
            Never quite buried<br>
            You cinephile in black and white<br>
            All those plot twists and dynamite<br>
            Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry<br>
            You said I'm the love of your life<br>
            <br>
            You shit-talked me under the table, talking rings and talking cradles<br>
            I wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all<br>
            Dancing phantoms on the terrace, are they second-hand embarrassed<br>
            That I can't get out of bed 'cause something counterfeit's dead?<br>
            It was legendary<br>
            It was momentary<br>
            It was unnecessary, should've let it stay buried<br>

            What a bland goodbye<br>
            The coward claimed he was a lion<br>
            I'm combing through the braids of lies<br>
            "I'll never leave"<br>
            "Never mind"<br>
            Our field of dreams, engulfed in fire<br>
            Your arson's match, your somber eyes<br>

            I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me<br>
            Like the plague<br>
            I cry a lot, but I am so productive<br>
            It's an art<br>
            You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart<br>
            <br>
            I can hold my breath<br>
            I've been doing it since he left<br>
            I keep finding his things in drawers<br>
            Crucial evidence, I didn't imagine the whole thing<br>
            I'm sure I can pass this test<br>
            <br>
            'Cause I'm a real tough kid<br>
            I can handle my shit<br>
            They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"<br>
            And I did<br>
            Lights, camera, bitch, smile<br>
            In stilettos for miles<br>
            He said he'd love me for all time<br>
            But that time was quite short<br>
            Breaking down, I hit the floor<br>
            All the pieces of me shattered<br>
            As the crowd was chanting "More!"<br>
            I was grinning like I'm winning<br>
            I was hitting my marks<br>
            'Cause I can do it with a broken heart<br>
            <br>
            I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday<br>
            Every day<br>

            You know you're good, and I'm good<br>
            'Cause I'm miserable!<br>
            And nobody even knows!<br>
            Try and come for my job

        <p id="dev-cal-2">
            Was any of it true?<br>
            Gazing at me starry-eyed<br>
            In your Jehovah's Witness suit<br>
            Who the fuck was that guy?<br>
            You tried to buy some pills<br>
            From a friend of friends of mine<br>
            They just ghosted you<br>
            Now you know what it feels like<br>
            <br>
            And I don't even want you back, I just want to know<br>
            If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal<br>
            And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give<br>
            A message to the smallest man who ever lived?<br>
            <br>
            You hung me on your wall<br>
            Stabbed me with your push pins<br>
            In public, showed me off<br>
            Then sank in stoned oblivion<br>
            'Cause once your queen had come<br>
            You'd treat her like an also-ran<br>
            You didn't measure up<br>
            In any measure of a man<br>
            <br>
            And I don't even want you back, I just want to know<br>
            If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal<br>
            And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give<br>
            A message to the smallest man who ever lived?<br>
            <br>
            Were you sent by someone<br>
            Who wanted me dead?<br>
            Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?<br>
            Were you writing a book?<br>
            Were you a sleeper cell spy?<br>
            In fifty years will all this be declassified?<br>
            And you'll confess why you did it<br>
            And I'll say, "Good riddance"<br>
            'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden<br>
            I would've died for your sins<br>
            Instead I just died inside<br>
            And you deserve prison, but you won't get time<br>
            You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars<br>
            You crashed my party and your rental car<br>
            You said normal girls were "boring"<br>
            But you were gone by the morning<br>
            You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing<br>
            And in plain sight you hid<br>
            But you are what you did<br>
            And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive<br>
